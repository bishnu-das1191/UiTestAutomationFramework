  cd UiTestAutomationFramework
```

**Running tests on LambdaTest-**

  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadLess=true -X 


**Running tests on chrome browser on local machine in Headless mode-**

  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadLess=true -X


## Reports and Logs
